# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
#
# To verify GPU is being used, check logs for:
#   "BiRefNet-portrait model moved to GPU"
#
# If you see "BiRefNet-portrait model using CPU" instead, your GPU
# may not be detected. Check:
#   python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
